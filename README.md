  I bought an e-bike in November 2020, it was life-changing, and now I have 4
  (pedal-assist, not throttle). I'm documenting my reflections about the e-bike
  space here, in the hope it will help others.

# E-bikes are a Transportation Revolution

![4 e-bikes on the Hoboken waterfront](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109428064-3fbf0900-79c3-11eb-97c5-cd2662676563.png)

## Index <a id="toc"></a>

* [Background](background.md): bike-sharer → bike-owner → e-bike maniac
* [My e-bikes](bikes.md)
  * [Overview/Specs](bikes.md#specs): weights between 35-60lbs, ranges from 25-130mi, prices from $1900-$7000 \($2500-$8000 incl. gear\)
  * [VanMoof X3](bikes.md#x3): great all-around / starter / city e-bike
  * [Brompton Electric](bikes.md#e-brompton): smallest fold, most portable, great all around
  * [Tern Vektron Q9](bikes.md#q9): large cargo capacity, folds up for easy storage
  * [Specialized Creo Comp Carbon](bikes.md#creo): light, fast, long-range
* [Reflections](reflections.md)
  * [Speed ⟹ Safety](reflections.md#speed-safety): higher top speed – and acceleration – make a big difference in traffic
  * [Speed ⟹ Inclusion](reflections.md#speed-inclusion): a lot more people can get around quickly+comfortably on ebikes
  * [Speed ⟹ Convenience](reflections.md#speed-convenience): ebikes are as fast as cars in urban environments; can solve congestion and parking issues
  * [Space](reflections.md#space): high mobility per unit space; combine with other modes \(trains, buses, ferries\)
    * [Bike vs. Car Storage](reflections.md#bike-vs-car-storage): parking takes too much space in cities, and is heavily subsidized; bike parking is 5-10x more efficient
  * [Cost](reflections.md#cost): the average car cost could fund e-bikes for 10 families
  * [Cargo](reflections.md#cargo):
    * [Groceries, Bulk Items](reflections.md#groceries): basically any grocery run, and a surprising number of bulk item moves, can be done via e-bike
    * [Kids](reflections.md#kids): easy to carry 1 or 2 kids by e-bike
    * [PoV: Grocery Runs](reflections.md#groceries): I get groceries by e-bike and it's great

  * [Health](reflections.md#health)
  * [Fun](reflections.md#fun)

  * [Post-Processing Videos](documenting-rides.md#post-processing-videos): dealing with videos afterward is its own adventure
    * [GoPros](documenting-rides.md#gopros) are pretty hard to deal with; telemetry data is often not recorded correctly, and the GoPro software ecosystem is a mess
