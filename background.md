  The COVID "bike boom" hit me hard:; I went from bike-sharer to bike-owner to
  e-bike maniac in 1 year.

# Background

### Timeline

* **2012 â†’ July 2020**:
  * Enthusiastic bike-share \([Citibike NYC](https://www.citibikenyc.com/)\) user.
  * Frequently: take train to a place/event, bike home; 1-way option is nice!
  * The bikes are heavy and slow, but convenient.
* **July 2020**:
  * Got a hand-me-down roadbike.
  * "I still love Citibike, but this is better for some trips/errands."
* **September 2020**:
  * Want something for grocery runs.
  * Bought a "hybrid" \(non-electric; [a cross between "road" and "mountain" bikes; basically a "city bike"](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/group-tests/hybrid-bikes-buyers-guide-206065)\). Revelatory, love it.
  * Got [lots of bags+accessories](gear.md) to fit different needs \(errands/cargo, distance/joy-ride, day in the city, etc.\)
* **November 2020**:
  * Still want to try an e-bike.
  * Ideally a hauler, that could also fold up for easy storage \(my office already had two wall-mounted bikes, but e-bikes are generally too heavy for that\).
  * Bought a [Tern Vektron Q9](https://www.ternbicycles.com/us/bikes/471/vektron-q9) \(folding + cargo bike\).
* **December â†’ January 2021**:
  * E-bikes are revolutionary and I need more ðŸ¤©.
  * Helping friends+family try+buy.
  * Market moving quickly; many fascinating takes on what an "electric bike" can be.
  * Bought [an electric roadbike](bikes.md#creo) and a [VanMoof X3](bikes.md#x3) \(all-purpose city e-bike\).
* **June 2021**:
  * Got a [Brompton Electric](bikes.md#e-brompton); small fold + portable, nice for little errands, bringing it inside buildings/restaurants
  * 3k total miles, mix of errands, recreation, and longer/overnight trips
